# Improvscoreboard Next Steps

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed
1. Server Modularization
   - Split monolithic server into focused modules
   - Created clean separation of concerns
   - Improved code organization

2. Testing Infrastructure
   - API testing script
   - WebSocket testing guide
   - Test coordination script

3. Documentation
   - Architecture (DEV_NOTES.md)
   - Feature addition guide (ADD_FEATURE_GUIDE.md)
   - Testing procedures

## Immediate Action Items

### 1. Verify Current Implementation
```bash
# Run full test suite
cd improvscoreboard
.\test_all.ps1

# Key things to verify:
- All WebSocket events work
- State management is consistent
- API endpoints respond correctly
```

### 2. Client Updates
1. Review client codebase for:
   - WebSocket event handling
   - State management integration
   - UI component organization

2. Consider similar modularization for client:
   - Split into feature-based components
   - Centralize state management
   - Organize WebSocket handlers

### 3. First New Feature
1. Implement game timer (as documented in ADD_FEATURE_GUIDE.md)
2. Use this as a test case for the new modular structure
3. Document any friction points or improvements needed

### 4. Technical Debt
1. Add automated tests
   - Unit tests for state management
   - Integration tests for WebSocket events
   - API endpoint tests

2. Implement state persistence
   - Add JSON file storage
   - Consider database integration
   - Add backup/restore functionality

3. Improve logging
   - Add structured logging
   - Implement error tracking
   - Add performance monitoring

### 5. DevOps Improvements
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline
2. Add automated deployment
3. Implement monitoring
4. Create backup strategy

## Decision Points

1. **Feature Priority**
   - Game timer implementation
   - State persistence
   - Additional UI features

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Manual vs automated
   - Test coverage goals
   - Integration test approach

3. **Deployment**
   - Hosting solution
   - Domain setup
   - SSL certificates

Would you like to:
1. Begin implementing the game timer feature
2. Start with client updates
3. Focus on automated testing
4. Work on another area
